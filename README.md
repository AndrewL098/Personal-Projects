There are oh so many undiscovered planets that are beyond our own. NASA maintains an exoplanet archive that contains all recorded data on exoplanets.

Today, we will explore the most common method for discovering exoplanets, potentially habitable zones of planetary systems, and the relationship between a star's luminosity and its temperature. 

Data Cleaning
First, we have to clean up the data. The archive includes all the data, which has duplicate data about the same exoplanet. Researchers often verify each other’s work, making multiple observations of each exoplanet. As a result, the archive has varying data about each exoplanet’s properties. I grouped the data by the name of the exoplanet and averaged the rest of the values. This got rid of all the duplicates. 

Discovery Method
Of the total 5921 exoplanets discovered so far, 4387 were discovered via the transit method. About 75% of all confirmed exoplanets were discovered with the transit method. The transit method looks for “dips” in light levels from a star. The second most common method is radial velocity, accounting for around 19% of all exoplanets discovered. The radial velocity method looks for slight wobbles of the parent star, caused by a massive orbiting exoplanet.


Habitable Zones
By using Stefan-Boltzmann's law (L = 4πR²σT⁴), we can calculate the luminosity of the parent star relative to our Sun. Then we can scale the habitable zone of our solar system to approximate the inner and outer radius of the habitable zone. 


This is a very rough estimation because we are not considering factors such as the metallicity of the star, the albedo of the planets, etc. 


Based on the approximations of the habitable zones, there are 103 potentially habitable planets. The exoplanet system with the largest habitable zone is HD 154391 b, with a habitable zone of 2.60 au.  Proxima Centauri b is the closest habitable exoplanet, being only 1.3 parsecs or 4.24 light-years away. Additionally, Proxima Centauri b has a planetary mass and radius similar to Earth’s. Thus, making Proxima Centauri b one of the best candidates for a getaway planet in case Earth gets destroyed. 

Hertzsprung–Russell diagram (Luminosity vs Temperature)
This graph was created with data from the NASA exoplanet archive*

The y-axis(Luminosity) is measured in solar luminosity (the wattage that our Sun produces). The x-axis (Surface Temperature) is measured in Kelvin. Both axes are scaled logarithmically to “linearize” the graph. 

(The x-axis was inverted to better match up with the HR diagram)

From this graph, we can see that there is a positive relationship between surface temperature and luminosity. As the star radiates out more energy and the surface temperature increases, the luminosity of the star would also increase. 

The reason there is a noticeable difference between my graph and the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram is that my data is on stars that have exoplanets discovered nearby. By comparing my graph with the HR diagram, we can see that most exoplanets have been discovered in the cooler part of the main sequence and some near giants. There seem to be very few exoplanets discovered near the hotter main-sequence stars. This could be due to the fact that hotter stars are generally bigger and more luminous. This makes the 2 most common exoplanet discovery methods harder to verify the existence of an exoplanet. The transit method that requires detecting a change in brightness will be less accurate if the change is minuscule. The radial velocity is less effective because the stars are many more factors larger than potential exoplanets, making the wobble less noticeable.
